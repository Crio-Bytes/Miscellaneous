# Background

Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets

# Activities

## Activity 0

Understanding "android structures"
Java and XML are the two main programming languages used in Android App development. Knowledge and mastery over these programming languages are, therefore, prerequisites to developing an Android app. Some of the fundamentals of the Java programming language include: Packages. Objects & classes.

## Activity 1-
First of all, create a new Android Studio project and in the manifest file add the following user-permissions:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.texttospeech">
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    ```
    
 Now in the activity_main.xml file, we will add an TextView and an ImageButton.I will not explain the layout file as I don‚Äôt want to waste anybody‚Äôs time who is here to learn the Speech to Text.

## Activity 2-
## Let‚Äôs dive into the MainActivity.java file.

## Activity 3-
Now here comes the important part first which will initialize the SpeecRecognizer object and then create the intent for recognizing the speech.
 
 As you can see we have added some extras let me explain what are they.
 The constant  **ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH** starts an activity that will prompt the user for speech and send it through a speech recognizer.
 
**EXTRA_LANGUAGE_MODEL:** Informs the recognizer which speech model to prefer when performing  ** ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH.**

**LANGUAGE_MODEL_FREE_FORM:** Use a language model based on free-form speech recognition.
**EXTRA_LANGUAGE:** optional IETF language tag (as defined by BCP 47), for example, ‚Äúen-US‚Äù.

Now we will set a speechRecognitionListener to our speechRecognizer object using the setRecognitionListener() method.

You can see after setting the listener we get several methods to implement. We will go the onResults method and add the following code
