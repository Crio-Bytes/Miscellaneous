# Introduction

It is the android game made in android studio named "Tic Tac Toe". Language used in this game is pure Java. There are some folders contain source code and  and the screenshots.


# Prerequisites

You need to install the android studio and JDK kit on your local machine. Just go to the oracle site https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html and download the JDK kit. After installing the JDK, confirm that JDK is installed successfully, To check the version of JDK install, just open the command line interface and type the command "java --version". 

Sometimes there is error occured even the JDK has been installed. So, I prefer the video of installation of Java Development kit (JDK) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwImJwo9gQ8
Note that you have to only installed JDK. 


And later install android studio.
After successfull installation copy file and paste into your andorid project and improve the issues.
